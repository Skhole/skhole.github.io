<h4>APPENDIX 3: RECORDS OF PROCESSING ACTIVITIES – Processing of personal data at Skhole</h4>

<h4>1. How does Skhole process personal data?</h4>

<p>Skhole processes personal data confidentially and only to the extent necessary. The starting point in all activities relating to the processing of personal data is the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679/EU). Personal data refers any information concerning an identifiable natural person (data subject). Examples of personal data include name, e-mail address and telephone number. On the other hand, information about which browser you are using is not necessarily personal data. </p>

<p>In Skhole’s learning environment, everyone with a Skhole user ID is a data subject. Processing of personal data refers to almost any activity pertaining to personal data, such as collection, recording, editing and even viewing personal data. The processing of personal data in Skhole is based on the consent of the data subject. The data subject can withdraw their consent at any time and that will result in the service not being available any more. </p>

<p>Skhole Oy is the controller of the data file comprising the personal data of the end user data subjects. This imposes certain obligations on Skhole. The data subject also has rights, and they are described in more detail below. The data subject may contact Skhole in all matters pertaining to the processing of personal data by printing out and submitting the form available through this link to Skhole’s office: </p>

<p>Skhole Oy, Paasivuorenkatu 4-6, FI-00530 Helsinki, Finland</p>

<p>Access to personal data in Skhole is strictly limited. Only employees who need to process personal data as part of their duties have access to it. These persons have also been trained to process personal data in a lawful way that respects data protection and data security. </p>

<p>Skhole takes data security seriously. The data security of the service is ensured through common and proven methods. The personal data processed by Skhole is located on the secure servers of those providers proven to be trustworthy. The level of data security is reviewed on a monthly basis, and the required updates are run regularly; if critical vulnerabilities occur, updates are run immediately. In addition to meticulous software development, vulnerabilities are prevented with hosting-level and DNS-level protection (Cloudflare). The employees with access to personal data use very strong and continuously changed passwords. Those who process personal data also use an encrypted VPN connection when outside the office. All employees are also subject to a non-disclosure obligation with regard to all personal data. </p>

<p>As a rule, Skhole stores the personal data it has collected for as long as is necessary for providing the service. Once the data subject ceases to be a user of Skhole’s service, the personal data concerning the data subject will be erased within six months. In this case, Skhole may anonymise the data so that study data can be utilised for statistical and research purposes. However, the data cannot be attributed to any individual person. </p>

<h4>2. Which personal data is collected and for what purpose?</h4>

<p>The starting point in the processing of personal data at Skhole is the “purpose limitation”. Therefore, the personal data we have collected will only be processed for the purpose for which it was collected. Personal data is primarily processed so that we can guarantee the end users the best learning experience and most effective service possible. At Skhole, personal data can only be used for providing the service, advertising the services, managing and developing the customer relationship (data subject–Skhole), ensuring events in the learning environment (including log-in, communication and providing feedback, passing courses and examinations), carrying out the company’s internal statistical follow-up and developing our service. </p>

<p>Skhole can collect the following data, some of which is personal data: name, IP address and location, identifying name of the user ID, e-mail address, browser details, operating system (e.g. Windows, iOS etc.), occupation, lecture feedback (including the lecture on which the feedback was provided, content of feedback, score given, time, name, e-mail address and group to which the data subject belongs), data subject’s organisation (e.g. educational institution or company), group name, number of log-ins to the learning environment, date of most recent use, registration data, data subject’s achievements (exams, tests, courses and their results) and clicks of e-mail links sent by Skhole. Test users are additionally requested to provide their telephone number, which may be called after the test period.</p>

<p>The data collected by Skhole is based on information collected by it and information provided by the data subject. </p>

<p>“Admin” users of educational institutions and other organisations have the right to add members of their organisation as Skhole users and delete their user IDs. In these cases, the data subject’s personal data (name, e-mail address, organisation) will be received from the admin user. Admin users have the right to view the following personal data concerning the data subjects they administer: name, user ID, e-mail address, name of the data subject’s group, date of the data subject’s most recent use, and the data subject’s achievements. </p>

<h4>3. Where will Skhole transfer data?</h4>

<p>Skhole uses the following services for providing its service: Heroku, Upcloud, Google Analytics, LogDNA, MailChimp, Intercom, mLab & Amazon's cloud services. In providing the service, Skhole may transfer the data subject’s personal data (name, e-mail address, IP address, data transmitted by the browser, information about the time of using the service, information about studying and courses) to these services. If the data subject uses CSC-Haka or Facebook log-in, Skhole can transmit personal data to these services in order to ensure the log-in. The EU General Data Protection Regulation is also applicable when the above-mentioned service providers process personal data collected by Skhole. Skhole can use external service providers that process personal data collected by Skhole under a “processor agreement”. </p>

<p>The servers used by Skhole are located within the European Union. </p>

<h4>4. Which rights does the data subject have?</h4>

<p>The data subject has the right to be informed by Skhole that personal data concerning the subject is processed, and they can choose to request the personal data concerning them from Skhole. If there are inaccuracies or errors in the personal data processed by Skhole, the data subject may demand that the data be rectified. The data subject similarly has the right to be forgotten. Thus, in some cases, the data subject can have the personal data concerning them erased. The data subject can also object to, or in certain cases restrict, the processing of their personal data. Having personal data erased and objecting to or restricting their processing will, however, lead to not being able to use the service provided by Skhole. The data subject can make an information request concerning their own personal data, for example, to Skhole using the form mentioned in section 1 above. In addition, the data subject has the right to prohibit direct marketing, and it will not prevent future use of the service. </p>

<p>Each data subject also has the right to lodge a complaint concerning the controller’s activities to the supervisory authority at any time. In Finland, the supervisory authority is the Data Protection Ombudsman.</p>

The record of personal data processing activities specifies the purpose, nature and duration of the processing of personal data and which personal data will be collected. The admin user shall only process personal data in accordance with the Company’s record of personal data processing activities, unless otherwise required by legislation.
